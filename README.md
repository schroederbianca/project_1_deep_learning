# Deep Learning Project: CIFAR-10
This project accompanies the lecture deep learning (392221; Module 39-M-Inf-DL) and handels the GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark.

A classifier from an existing network has been used for applying several different attacks (e.g. few pixel attack). The success rates of the different attack methods are discussed and evaluated concerning their noticability by a human.
